# Cryptic transmission before detection (CTW framework)

This repository contains Python scripts to reproduce all main and
supplementary figures associated with the manuscript:

**Cryptic transmission before detection in host–vector–pathogen systems**

The code implements a simulation-based framework for quantifying
*cryptic transmission windows* (CTW), focusing on the temporal mismatch
between pathogen transmission and symptom-based detectability.

## Repository contents

### Scripts

Each figure in the manuscript is generated by a single, standalone
Python script:

- `figure1_bw.py`  
  **Figure 1** – Illustrative example of temporal decoupling between
  infection dynamics and beetle-based observability.

- `figure2_bw.py`  
  **Figure 2** – Parameter-space structure underlying cryptic invasion
  dynamics.

- `figure3_bw.py`  
  **Figure 3** – Comparison of management strategies under alternative
  detection assumptions.

- `figureS1_bw.py`  
  **Figure S1** – Robustness of cryptic invasion dynamics across network
  structures.

- `figureS2_bw.py`  
  **Figure S2** – Robustness of results to alternative latency
  distributions.

- `figureS3_bw.py`  
  **Figure S3** – Supplementary analyses including economic and
  sensitivity assessments.

Scripts are independent and can be executed individually to reproduce
the corresponding figure.

## Reproducing the figures

### 1. Install dependencies

All required Python packages can be installed using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run a figure script

From the `scripts/` directory, run any script, for example:

```bash
python figure1_bw.py
```

Each script generates high-resolution PNG and PDF files of the figure.
